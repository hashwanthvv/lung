A Modified Boolean Network Approach to Model Feedback in Lung Cancer

This repository contains the Matlab implementation of multi-fault modified boolean network for Lung Cancer.

Step 1: Open the files in Matlab.

Step 2: Set the number of combinations of drugs in line 1 of "script.m" (minimum:1, maximum:6, default is set to 3).

Step 3: Run "script.m".

The Area under curve (AUCs) corresponding to one fault, two faults, and three faults will be displayed.
